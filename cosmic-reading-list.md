# first time building a website using AI

As you all know, I have built this site using ChatGPT AI. This is my first experience as a newbie in the coding world!
I didn't know this much is happening behind the scenes on this website & how to bring it to life via GitHub and other stuff...

So I will keep this short, that I love the way it came, and I will try to improve this site soon...

Stay tuned for more to come :)
